# bioinactivation4

The bioinactivation package for R includes several function for building and applying microbial inactivation models (Garre et al., 2017). This package is available on CRAN, making it easy to install in any computer with R. The package is Open Source, with the source code available on GitHub:

Although this package facilitates the application of predictive microbiology, its use requires some knowledge of R programming. In order to give users without that skill access to the tools implemented in the package, we first developed bioinactivation FE (Garre et al., 2018), a web application that provided  a user-friendly interface to the functions included in the bioinactivation package. 
This user manual describes an updated version of the web application: bioinactivation4. It is an modernization of the user interface based on bootstrap4. It also includes additional functions that were not included in bioinactivation FE. The application is available freely on

The application is Open Source, with the source code available on GitHub:

Bioinactivation4 can also be used on computers without internet connection. In this case, however, the software must be installed locally. Please contact the maintainers of the software for this.
